The above code is used to add the csv format file to the Google Colab for the further work to be done with it.<br/>

In the above, plotting for the correlation, the numeric and non-numeric data are taken and considered separately.<br/>

# Writeup for the day :

- The code was done with the help of the reference code given by making the required changes in it. The required concepts to complete it was learnt with the help of the sites referred and with the help of the AI platforms (ChatGPT and Gemini, which is already available in the Google Colab).
The use of Gemini made it easier for me to figure out my mistakes easily by which the time I was able to utilise to learn the concepts required.<br/>

- Things learnt for the day :- Reading the file to the Google Colab, Understanding the data, Cleaning the data by figuring out the null values and unrequired columns or entries in it and clearing it accordingly, Finding and handling the outliers and after that most importantly EDA (where the data is visualized in a more meaningful way with the help of scatterplots and line graphs and all. Together with the correlation part is also been checked and I think I need to learn more about this topic to get even more a deep understanding of the topic.<br/>
  A cleaned data obtained at the end.<br/>

- Blockers faced :- To continue with the code of the correlation part which I somehow understood what the error is due to and learnt how to solve it by searching on it further. But I need to go through it once again.<br/>
